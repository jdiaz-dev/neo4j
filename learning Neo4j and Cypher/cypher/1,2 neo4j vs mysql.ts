  --the joins are calculated in  query time
  --these operations are compute heavy and intense-memory and has an exponential cost
  --for instance in a relation many to many we have an intermediate table (motivated by denormalization), where need access to the intermadiate table to access to end relation
  --the graph database give importante to the relation and data itself
  --with grahp database, the data statys remarkably similar to its form or real world - small- normalized and richly connected entities
  --it allows to see to data from interesting view point
  --the relational database offer clarity  and a graph database also
