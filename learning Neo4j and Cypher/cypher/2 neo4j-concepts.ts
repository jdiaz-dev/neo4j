    **Nodes 
    --the node can have tags to its classification
    --the tags has index that  allow to access to node in very quick way
    
    **Relations
    --relationate nodes by type and direction
    --it can have many relations (edges)
    --the relations has a verb, it explain the relation
    
    
    **Properties
    --without a strict schema as MongoDB
    --the node and relations can have properties 
    --these attributes of node and relations
    --these are stored in key/value format

  --with Ne4j, we can implements analitic and transactional solutions 
    1. graph transactions elements (context of an element, make a zoom in point of graph and see the context). it is very usefull for realtime systems for instance
    2. graph analytics

    --we can integrate with any monitoring system like graphana

/* 
  graph algoritms
    --the graph siencie library has as 50 algorithms implemented
    --the graph siencie library, grouped in the next 5 categories
    1. Pathfinding and search (element connections )
    2. Centrally / importance (means importance of an element), it is very mathematic, but always there a translation to bussines logic, therefore we can make bussines actions with information provided with these algoritms
    3. Community detection, to group relationated data
    4. Similarity
    5. Link prediction
